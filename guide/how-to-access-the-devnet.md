## Contract Deployment Tutorial
We welcome everyone to deploy and call smart contract on Jovay. This section will introduce how to deploy and call smart contracts compiled by DTVM on jovay. All operators below are demonstrated on **Ubuntu 22.04**.

Before that, you need : 

1. prepare environment dependencies
    ```
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install nodejs npm    # node version must bigger than 22.x
    sudo apt-get install solc      # solc version must bigger than 0.8.25
    ```
2. Prepare DTVM_SolSDK to complie solidity into wasm bytecode. You could download DTVM_SolSDK from [here](https://github.com/DTVMStack/DTVM_SolSDK/releases/tag/v0.1.0), we use [DTVM_SolSDK-0.1.0-Linux-ubuntu22.04.tar.gz](https://github.com/DTVMStack/DTVM_SolSDK/releases/download/v0.1.0/DTVM_SolSDK-0.1.0-Linux-ubuntu22.04.tar.gz)
    ```
    cd ~
    wget https://github.com/DTVMStack/DTVM_SolSDK/releases/download/v0.1.0/DTVM_SolSDK-0.1.0-Linux-ubuntu22.04.tar.gz
    mkdir dtvm
    tar -zxvf DTVM_SolSDK-0.1.0-Linux-ubuntu22.04.tar.gz -C dtvm
    ```

3. deposit some ETH into your Jovay account `0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6` from Sepolia through the `Deposit` operation in the [Bridge between Sepolia and Jovay](#how-to-apply-for-a-trial) to facilitate subsequent operations.

4. For simplicity, we provide example scripts for deploying and calling contract by web3js. And you can also use web3js to interact with the Jovay yourself without the example.

```shell
tree jovay-guide
jovay-guide
├── conf
│   └── abi
│       ├── JovayExample.json      // the abi of example contract
│       ├── L1ETHBridge.json       // the abi of bridge contract on Sepolia used by bridging
│       └── L2ETHBridge.json       // the abi of bridge contract on Jovay used by bridging
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── scripts
│   ├── eth_bridge.js              // the script for bridging ETH; include deposit, withdraw, finalizeWithdraw
│   └── interact_with_contract.js  // the scripy for deploy and call contract on Jovay
└── src
    └── contracts
        └── jovay_example.sol

6 directories, 8 files
```

Now, we have a simple example contract:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract JovayExample {
    string private content = "welcome to Jovay";

    function SetContent(string memory _new_content) public {
        content = _new_content;
    }

    function GetContent() public view returns (string memory){
        return content;
    }
}
```

The example contract above can be found injovay-guide.tar.gz. And our following operations are based on this script package.
```
cd ~
mkdir jovay-guide
tar -zxvf jovay-guide.tar.gz -C jovay-guide/
cd jovay-guide/
npm install
```

Before using scripts, you should prepare `.env` with `.env.l2.example`; And you need to obtain a `L2_RPC_URL` in [How to Apply for a Trial](#how-to-apply-for-a-trial) .
```solidity{.env.l2.example}
L2_RPC_URL="url for Jovay"

// The account you haven deposited from Sepolia on Jovay
L2_OWNER_ADDR=foo

// The private key of the account you haven deposited on Jovay. 
L2_PRIVATE_KEY=bar
```

First, complie solidity smart contract to wasm bytecode:
```
cd ~/jovay-guide/
// Step 1: Compile Solidity to Yul IR
solc --ir --optimize-yul -o . --overwrite src/contracts/jovay_example.sol

// Step 2: Compile Yul IR to WebAssembly
yul2wasm --input JovayExample.yul --output jovay_example.wasm
```

Second, deploy wasm bytecode by `scripts/interact_with_contract.js`:
```
node scripts/interact_with_contract.js deploy jovay_example.cbin.hex
```
| Parameter  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|wasm bytecode  | jovay_example.cbin.hex  | the wasm bytecode will be deployed  |
|`gas_price` | 4  | max fee of per gas  |

deployed contract address  will be displayed as shown below:
```
contractAddress: '0x3b87b43889bbe72b9d6175c7c7f91c54814c6134',
```

And then, you can call contract `0x3b87b43889bbe72b9d6175c7c7f91c54814c6134` on Jovay, use below script to call SetContentinterface:
```
node scripts/interact_with_contract.js call_SetContent 0x3b87b43889bbe72b9d6175c7c7f91c54814c6134 conf/abi/JovayExample.json "hellojovay" 4 
```
| Parameter  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|contract address  | 0x3b87b43889bbe72b9d6175c7c7f91c54814c6134  | the contract address on Jovay you want to call;  |
|abi  | conf/abi/JovayExample.json  | the abi file of contract  |
|method parameter  | "hellojovay" | the method parameter of `SetContent`  |
|`gas_price` | 4  | max fee of per gas  |


## Bridge ETH between Sepolia and Jovay
Now, you will learn how to bridge ETH between Sepolia and Jovay.

Jovay provide ETH bridge contracts for bridging eth between Sepolia and Jovay; 

- ETH Bridge Contract on Sepolia : `0x10Ec05757Af363080443110BFd2e86C4406E4732`
- ETH Bridge Contract on Jovay : `0x38675d92813338953b0f67e9cc36be59282b77e3`

You can deposit ETH from Sepolia to Jovay by calling `deposit` on Sepolia. And withdraw ETH from Jovay back to Sepolia by calling `withdraw` on Jovay.

### Deposit From Sepolia to Jovay
```
/**
 * user deposit eth from Sepolia to Jovay;
 * @param to_; deposit target address on Jovay;
 * @param amount_; deposit amount;
 * @param gasLimit_; gas limit of finalize deposit on Jovay（should bigger 1200000）
 * @param msg_; Not used yet, extended field; please set "0x"
 */
function deposit(address to_, uint256 amount_, uint256 gasLimit_, bytes memory msg_) external payable;
```

### WithDraw From Jovay to Sepolia
```solidity
/**
 * user withdraw eth from Jovay to Sepolia;
 * @param to_; withdraw target address on Sepolia;
 * @param amount_; withdraw amount;
 * @param gasLimit_; gas limit of finalize withdraw on Sepolia （should bigger 150000）
 * @param msg_; Not used yet, extended field; please set "0x"
 */
function withdraw(address to_, uint256 amount_, uint256 gasLimit_, bytes memory msg_) external payable;

/**
 * finalize withdraw and transfer eth to target address on Sepolia;
 * @param amount_; withdraw amount;
 * @param nonce_; the L2 withdraw tx's nonce of L2 Msg queue; 
 * @param msg_; Not used yet, extended field; please set "0x"
 * @param proof_; the proof of L2 Msg; include batch_index and spv_proof;
 */
function relayMsgWithProof(
    uint256 amount_,
    uint256 nonce_,
    bytes memory msg_,
    IL1Mailbox.L2MsgProof memory proof_
) external payable;
```
And，we also put the bridge operation script in jovay-guide.tar.gz.

Before bridging ETH，you should prepare `.env` by replacing the `private_key` and `owner_addr` in `.env.bridge.example` with yours; And configure the L2_RPC_URL address obtained in section [How to Apply for a Trial](#how-to-apply-for-a-trial).

```shell {.env.bridge.example}
RPC_URL="url of sepolia"
L2_RPC_URL="url of Jovay"

# the address and private key of your account on Sepolia
L1_OWNER_ADDR=foo
L1_PRIVATE_KEY=foo

# the address and private key of your account on Jovay
L2_OWNER_ADDR=bar
L2_PRIVATE_KEY=bar

L1_ETH_BRIDGE_ADDR=0xe4eec6BF3cb40DD1b042bA71DB6af8C815E12B26
L2_ETH_BRIDGE_ADDR=0xf17c411483d259b50ab9604f69802bf6e4083fd6

L1_ETH_BRIDGE_ABI=conf/abi/L1ETHBridge.json
L2_ETH_BRIDGE_ABI=conf/abi/L2ETHBridge.json
```

Second, if you want to deposit ETH from Sepolia to address `0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6` on Jovay. Please use the below command: 
```
node scripts/eth_bridge.js depositEth 0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6 10000000000 7000000 11000000000 40630943068 
```
| Parameter  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| `to`  | 0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6  | deposit target address on Jovay  |
|`amount`  | 10000000000 (wei)   | the amount want to transfer to deposit target address  |
|`gaslimit`   | 7000000   | the gaslimit you want set for L2 transfer transaction associated with L1  |
| `value`  | 11000000000 (wei) | the value you should pay for deposit must bigger than the sum of gaslimit and amount  |
|`gas_price` | 40630943068  | max fee of per gas  |


And then，if you want withdraw ETH from Jovay to Sepolia，you should send two transactions `withdraw` on Jovay and `finalizeWithdraw` on Sepolia. 

1. Withdraw on Jovay, which is only transfer ETH from sender to Bridge Contract on Jovay, not transfer to withdraw target address on Sepolia;

```
node scripts/eth_bridge.js withdrawEth 0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6 105 1130000 1200000 40630943068 
```
| Parameter  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| `to`  | 0x7CaD994FC1c0d94ef232FBe3b45B685018Ee59B6  | withdraw target address on Sepolia.  |
|`amount`  | amount	105 (wei)   | the amount want to transfer to withdraw target address.  |
|`gaslimit`   | 1130000  | the gaslimit you want set for L1 transfer transaction associated with L2.  |
| `value`  | 1200000 (wei)  | the value you should pay for withdraw must bigger than the sum of gaslimit and amount.  |
|`gas_price` | 40630943068  | max fee of per gas  |


2. Finalize withdraw on Sepolia, finishing withdraw on Sepolia. Bridge Contract will transfer ETH to withdraw target address on Sepolia according to the L2 Msg sent by L2 Withdraw Transaction. The following commands can only be executed after the transaction is finailized on Sepolia. You can confirm whether the L2 Withdraw Transaction is finalized through the explorer.

```
 node scripts/eth_bridge.js finalizeWithdraw 568 0x1fc547fd2e2793de5639a6d01d36b16962d4f7bbccf4eb8c2460b80b2387f1f4 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000AD3228B676F7D3CD4284A5443F17F1962B36E491B30A40B2405849E597BA5FB549907CABA6026FC29793BCD2643CC473EA1961E750D21D0CA0681B6BC47036F721DDB9A356815C3FAC1026B6DEC5DF3124AFBADB485C9BA5A3E3398A04B7BA8508C69FA8494A232D4152ED4E9804888ACB9736E5B573A91C7C8286C8BD94FCDF11D320ECF7A95981F47E88A7E45E7D3BF3EFE42A3725F02F8E529B85A0F2D10480C2EB2A1D9ED30415BAC4EDBE840944AC03B0EE4EA8EA564ECE94177EA3CADC 40630943068
```
| Parameter  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| `batch_index`  | 568  | the batch index of withdraw tx hash. you can find at [jovay explorer](http://explorer.jovay.io/l2/home?bizId=ethdevnetl2&unionId=100100).</br>![jovay explorer-1](./Images/Access/jovay%20explorer-1.png)<br>![jovay explorer-2](./Images/Access/jovay%20explorer-2.png)  |

## Jovay API
Jovay is fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem, offering native support for standard Ethereum JSON-RPC interfaces. Developers can seamlessly integrate using popular tools and libraries such as Web3j, Web3.js, or ethers.js, without the need for custom adaptations. This enables existing Ethereum applications to migrate or expand to the Jovay with minimal effort, reducing integration costs and accelerating development.

The table2 indicates how each **Ethereum JSON-RPC** method behaves on the Jovay. All request and response parameters follow the canonical [Ethereum JSON-RPC specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/). Only the runtime semantics differ for entries marked with ⚠️.

table1: Status Meanings in table2
| Status  | Meaning on Jovay  | Guidance for dApp developers  |
|---|---|---|
| ✅  | **Fully compatible** – request and response semantics are identical to Ethereum mainnet.  | Use the method exactly as defined in the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification.  |
| ⚠️ | **Semantically different** – the method is implemented, but its return value or behavior diverges (e.g., no PoW, no uncle blocks, L2-specific proofs). See the Note column for details.  | Review the deviation and add fallback logic if required.  |
| ❌ | **Not supported** – the method is not available (typically wallet or filter features).  | Replace, stub, or omit the call until future support is announced.  |

table2: Jovay JSON-RPC List
| Ethereum JSON-RPC API | Status  | Note  |
|---|---|---|
| eth_protocolVersion | ⚠️ | Always Returns `0x41`  |
